      <h2>Week 1 | Order of Operations</h2>
      <p>
      <pre>
<p>I will explain the importance of order of operations in mathematics to ensure consistent and accurate calculations.</p>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Order of Operations</h3>
<h4>Introduction to Order of Operations</h4>
Define order of operations as a set of rules to determine the sequence in which mathematical operations are performed.
<h4>Introduce the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right) as a mnemonic device to remember the order.</h4>
<h4>Parentheses and Brackets</h4>
Explain that expressions within parentheses or brackets must be evaluated first.
Emphasize the importance of simplifying expressions within parentheses before moving to other operations.
Provide examples and guide the students through the process.
<h4>Exponents</h4>
Define exponents as a shorthand way of representing repeated multiplication.
Teach students how to evaluate expressions with exponents by multiplying the base by itself the number of times indicated by the exponent.
Demonstrate examples and provide practice problems for students to solve.
<h3>Part 2: Applying Order of Operations (45 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Multiplication and Division</h4>
Explain that multiplication and division should be performed from left to right, following the order of operations.
Emphasize the need to perform these operations before addition and subtraction.
Provide examples and guide the students through solving expressions involving multiplication and division.
<h4>Addition and Subtraction</h4>
Explain that addition and subtraction should be performed from left to right, following the order of operations.
Reinforce the concept that addition and subtraction should be performed after parentheses, exponents, multiplication, and division.
Demonstrate examples and guide the students through solving expressions involving addition and subtraction.
<h4>Complex Expressions</h4>
Present complex expressions that involve multiple operations, including parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.
Guide students through step-by-step solutions, emphasizing the correct order of operations.
