      <h2>Week 1 | Order of Operations</h2>
      <p>
      <pre>
<p>I will explain the importance of order of operations in mathematics to ensure consistent and accurate calculations.</p>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Order of Operations</h3>
<h4>Introduction to Order of Operations</h4>
Define order of operations as a set of rules to determine the sequence in which mathematical operations are performed.
<h4>Introduce the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, 
  Addition and Subtraction from left to right) 
as a mnemonic device to remember the order.</h4>
<h4>Parentheses and Brackets</h4>
Explain that expressions within parentheses or brackets must be evaluated first.
Emphasize the importance of simplifying expressions within parentheses before moving to other operations.
Provide examples and guide the students through the process.
<h4>Exponents</h4>
Define exponents as a shorthand way of representing repeated multiplication.
Teach students how to evaluate expressions with exponents by multiplying the base by itself the number of times 
indicated by the exponent.
Demonstrate examples and provide practice problems for students to solve.
<h3>Part 2: Applying Order of Operations (45 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Multiplication and Division</h4>
Explain that multiplication and division should be performed from left to right, following the order of operations.
Emphasize the need to perform these operations before addition and subtraction.
Provide examples and guide the students through solving expressions involving multiplication and division.
<h4>Addition and Subtraction</h4>
Explain that addition and subtraction should be performed from left to right, following the order of operations.
Reinforce the concept that addition and subtraction should be performed after parentheses, exponents, 
multiplication, and division.
Demonstrate examples and guide the students through solving expressions involving addition and subtraction.
<h4>Complex Expressions</h4>
Present complex expressions that involve multiple operations, including parentheses, exponents, multiplication, 
division, addition, and subtraction.
Guide students through step-by-step solutions, emphasizing the correct order of operations.

    <h2>Week 2 | Prime Factorization; GCF, and LCM</h2>
    <p>This lesson is designed for students who have some understanding of basic multiplication and factors.</p>
    <h3>Introduction to Prime Factorization</h3>
    <p>Start with a warm-up activity: Ask students to list all the factors of a given number (e.g., 24 or 36).
      Review the concept of factors and identify the factors as pairs that multiply to give the original number.
      Introduce Prime Numbers: Define prime numbers as numbers greater than 1 that have only two factors: 1 and
      the number itself.
      Provide examples of prime numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.).
      Prime Factorization: Explain that every composite number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers.
      Demonstrate how to find the prime factorization of a number using a step-by-step approach.
      Start with small numbers to illustrate the process clearly.
      Practice: Provide several numbers for the students to find their prime factorization.
      Encourage them to work individually or in pairs and discuss their findings afterward.</p>
    <h3>Greatest Common Factor (GCF)</h3>
    <p>Review Factors: Reiterate the concept of factors and remind students how to find factors of a number.
      Define GCF: Introduce the concept of Greatest Common Factor (GCF) as the largest factor that two or more
      numbers have in common.
      Finding GCF: Demonstrate different methods to find the GCF, such as listing factors, prime factorization,
      or using a Venn diagram.
      Practice: Provide pairs of numbers for students to find their GCF. Encourage them to use any of the methods
      they've learned.</p>
    <h3> Least Common Multiple (LCM)</h3>
    <p>Review Multiples: Recap the concept of multiples and how to find multiples of a number.
      Define LCM: Introduce the concept of Least Common Multiple (LCM) as the smallest multiple that two or more
      numbers have in common.
      Finding LCM: Explain different methods to find the LCM, such as listing multiples or using the prime
      factorization method.
      Practice: Provide pairs of numbers for students to find their LCM. Encourage them to use any of the methods
      they've learned.</p>
    <h3>Applying GCF and LCM in Real-Life Problems</h3>
    <p>Real-Life Scenarios: Present students with word problems that require them to use GCF and LCM to solve everyday
      situations (e.g., distributing objects equally, scheduling tasks, etc.).
      Group Activities: Divide the students into groups and assign them different word problems involving GCF and LCM.
      Allow them to discuss and solve the problems collaboratively.
      Share Solutions: Have each group present their solutions to the class, explaining their thought process and how
      they applied GCF and LCM to solve the problems.</p>
