      <h3>Part 1: Understanding Fractions</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions.html" target="_blank">What are Fractions?</a></h4>
      A way to represent parts of a whole.
      Fractions consist of two parts: a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).
      The numerator represents the number of parts we have, and the denominator represents the total number of equal parts.
      <h4>Types of Fractions</h4>
      The three main types of fractions: <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/proper-fractions.html" target="_blank">proper fractions</a>, <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/improper-fractions.html" target="_blank">improper fractions</a>, and <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/mixed-fractions.html", target="_blank">mixed numbers</a>.
      Proper fractions: Numerator is smaller than the denominator (e.g., 3/5).
      Improper fractions: Numerator is equal to or greater than the denominator (e.g., 7/4).
      Mixed numbers: A whole number combined with a proper fraction (e.g., 2 1/3).
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/equivalent_fractions.html" target="_blank">Equivalent Fractions</a></h4>
      Equivalent fractions represent the same value but are written differently.
      You can find equivalent fractions by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same number.
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/comparing-fractions.html" target="_blank">Comparing Fractions</a></h4>
      Discuss the concept of comparing fractions.
      You can use visual aids (fraction strips, circles, or number lines) to compare fractions with the same denominator or the same numerator.
      <h4>Converting Between Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions</h4>
      I will show you how to convert mixed numbers to improper fractions and vice versa.
      I will explain the process step-by-step, emphasizing the role of the numerator and denominator.

      <h3>Part 2: Operations with Fractions</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions_addition.html" target="_blank">Adding</a> and <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions_subtraction.html" target="_blank">Subtracting</a> Fractions with the Same Denominator</h4>
      When adding or subtracting fractions with the same denominator, we add or subtract the numerators while keeping the denominator the same.
      I will provide several examples and guide you through the process.
      <h4>Adding and Subtracting Fractions with Different Denominators</h4>
      I will introduce the concept of finding a common denominator.
      I will demonstrate how to find the <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/least-common-denominator.html" target="_blank">least common denominator</a> (LCD) and use it to add or subtract fractions with different denominators.
      I will guide you through several practice problems.
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions_multiplication.html" target="_blank">Multiplying Fractions</a></h4>
      I will explain that when multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.
      I will emphasize the importance of <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/simplifying-fractions.html" target="_blank">simplifying</a> the resulting fraction, if possible.
      I will porovide examples and give students an opportunity to practice multiplying fractions.
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions_division.html" target="_blank">Dividing Fractions</a></h4>
      I will teach the process of dividing fractions by multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal (flipped version) of the second fraction.
      I will reinforce the need to simplify the resulting fraction.
      I will provide examples and allow you to practice dividing fractions.

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>Decimals</p>
    <p>This lesson is designed for students who are new to decimals or need a refresher on the topic. The lesson will
      cover the basics of decimals,
      their relationship to fractions, operations with decimals, and real-life applications.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/decimals-menu.html" target="_blank">Introduction to Decimals</a></h3>
    <p>
      Let's start with a warm-up activity: You'll convert simple fractions into decimals.
      For example, convert 1/2, 3/4, and 2/5 into decimals.
      Let's review the answers as a class.
      Decimals are a way of representing parts of a whole using place value and the base-ten system.
      For example, 0.5 represents half whole, 0.75 represents three-quarters of a whole, etc.
      Decimal place value: Let's discuss the concept of place value in decimals, using a place value chart to show the
      positions of tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and so on.

      Representing decimals: Demonstrate how to read and say decimals correctly. For example, 0.25 is read as
      "twenty-five hundredths," and 0.75 is read as "seventy-five hundredths."
      Practice: I will provide a set of decimal numbers for you to read aloud. Include numbers with different decimal
      places, such as 0.3, 0.47, 0.125, etc.
      You'll read the numbers individually and as a group.

    <h3>Relating Decimals and Fractions</h3>
    <p>A recap on fractions - recall that decimals and fractions are related.
      For example, 0.5 is equivalent to 1/2, 0.75 is equivalent to 3/4, etc.
      Converting decimals to fractions:
      Here's how to convert decimals to fractions step-by-step.
      I'll use examples like 0.4, 0.25, and 0.6.
      Simplify the fractions when possible.
      Converting fractions to decimals:
      Here's how to convert fractions to decimals, such as 3/5, 7/10, and 5/8.
      Practice: I'll provide a mix of decimal and fraction conversion problems for you to solve on your own or in
      pairs.
      Please compare answers with your peers.
    </p>
    <h3> Operations with Decimals</h3>
    <p>
      Addition and Subtraction:
      Recognize the importance of aligning the decimal points when performing these operations.
      Multiplication:
      Here's how to multiply decimals.
      Observer the placement of the decimal point in the product and how the number of decimal places works.
      Division:
      Let's discuss division with decimals.
      We'll use examples like dividing money or measuring ingredients to make it relatable.
      Practice: I will provide a worksheet with various problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
      division
      of decimals.
      Please work through these problems.</p>
    <h3>Real-Life Applications of Decimals</h3>
    <p>
      Practical examples: As you know, decimals are very often used in real-life situations, such as money,
      measurements, and statistics.
      Money: Decimals are used in money transactions, like making change, calculating discounts, and budgeting.
      Measurements: Decimals are used in measurements, such as length, weight, and volume.
      Statistics: Decimals are used in representing percentages and decimal numbers in statistical data.
