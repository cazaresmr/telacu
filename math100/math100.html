      <h3>Part 1: Understanding Fractions</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions.html" target="_blank">What are Fractions?</a></h4>
      A way to represent parts of a whole.
      Fractions consist of two parts: a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).
      The numerator represents the number of parts we have, and the denominator represents the total number of equal parts.
      <h4>Types of Fractions</h4>
      The three main types of fractions: <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/proper-fractions.html" target="_blank">proper fractions</a>, <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/improper-fractions.html" target="_blank">improper fractions</a>, and <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/mixed-fractions.html", target="_blank">mixed numbers</a>.
      Proper fractions: Numerator is smaller than the denominator (e.g., 3/5).
      Improper fractions: Numerator is equal to or greater than the denominator (e.g., 7/4).
      Mixed numbers: A whole number combined with a proper fraction (e.g., 2 1/3).
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/equivalent_fractions.html" target="_blank">Equivalent Fractions</a></h4>
      Equivalent fractions represent the same value but are written differently.
      You can find equivalent fractions by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same number.
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/comparing-fractions.html" target="_blank">Comparing Fractions</a></h4>
      Discuss the concept of comparing fractions.
      You can use visual aids (fraction strips, circles, or number lines) to compare fractions with the same denominator or the same numerator.
      <h4>Converting Between Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions</h4>
      I will show you how to convert mixed numbers to improper fractions and vice versa.
      I will explain the process step-by-step, emphasizing the role of the numerator and denominator.

      <h3>Part 2: Operations with Fractions</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions_addition.html" target="_blank">Adding</a> and <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions_subtraction.html" target="_blank">Subtracting</a> Fractions with the Same Denominator</h4>
      When adding or subtracting fractions with the same denominator, we add or subtract the numerators while keeping the denominator the same.
      I will provide several examples and guide you through the process.
      <h4>Adding and Subtracting Fractions with Different Denominators</h4>
      I will introduce the concept of finding a common denominator.
      I will demonstrate how to find the <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/least-common-denominator.html" target="_blank">least common denominator</a> (LCD) and use it to add or subtract fractions with different denominators.
      I will guide you through several practice problems.
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions_multiplication.html" target="_blank">Multiplying Fractions</a></h4>
      I will explain that when multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.
      I will emphasize the importance of <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/simplifying-fractions.html" target="_blank">simplifying</a> the resulting fraction, if possible.
      I will porovide examples and give students an opportunity to practice multiplying fractions.
      <h4><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/fractions_division.html" target="_blank">Dividing Fractions</a></h4>
      I will teach the process of dividing fractions by multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal (flipped version) of the second fraction.
      I will reinforce the need to simplify the resulting fraction.
      I will provide examples and allow you to practice dividing fractions.
