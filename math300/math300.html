        <h2>Week 1 | 3-1: Measures of Center</h2>
        <p><pre>
        The measures of center are statistical values that represent the typical or central value of a data set.
        
        <h3>Part 1: Understanding Measures of Center (20 minutes)</h3>
        <h4>Mean (Average)</h4>
        Define the mean as the sum of all data values divided by the total number of values.
        Explain that the mean is affected by outliers and can be influenced by extreme values.
        Show the formula for calculating the mean and provide examples for the students to practice.
        <h4>Median</h4>
        Define the median as the middle value in an ordered data set.
        Explain that the median is unaffected by outliers and is used to represent the "typical" value.
        Demonstrate how to find the median for both odd and even-sized data sets, and provide examples for the students to practice.
        <h4>Mode</h4>
        Define the mode as the value(s) that appear most frequently in a data set.
        Explain that a data set can have multiple modes (multimodal) or no mode (no repeated values).
        Show how to identify the mode(s) and provide examples for the students to practice.
        <h3>Part 2: Calculating and Interpreting Measures of Center (45 minutes)</h3>
        <h4>Comparing Mean, Median, and Mode</h4>
        Discuss the similarities and differences among the mean, median, and mode.
        Explain when each measure of center is most appropriate to use depending on the characteristics of the data set.
        <h4>Data Distribution</h4>
        Introduce the concept of data distribution, including skewed, symmetric, and uniform distributions.
        Demonstrate how the measures of center can provide insights into the shape of the data distribution.
        Use visual aids (graphs or histograms) to illustrate different distributions and their corresponding measures of center.

        <h4>Interquartile Range (IQR) and Outliers</h4>
        Define the interquartile range as the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) in an ordered data set.
        Explain how the IQR helps identify potential outliers and describe the process of identifying outliers using the IQR method.
        Provide examples and guide the students through the calculation and interpretation of the IQR.
